# Equipment Cost & Financing Research

## Spray Foam Equipment Cost Findings:

### Basic Equipment Costs:
- **Basic spray foam rigs**: Start at $40,000
- **Fully equipped trailers**: $150,000+ with high-end equipment
- **PMC Premier Horizontal Hydraulic/Electric Proportioner**: 40-lbs/min output, 2,000 psi max working pressure
- **Chicago Pneumatic Rotary Screw Air Compressor**: 7.5 hp 3-Phase, 23 CFM @ 150 psi
- **Heated hoses**: Standard 210' for insulation rigs, 310' for roofing rigs

### Essential Equipment Components:
1. **Proportioner/Reactor**: Heats and pumps chemicals at 1:1 ratio (40-60 kW power needed)
2. **3-Phase Compressor**: 15-20 CFM at 100 PSI minimum
3. **Foam Generator**: 40kW 3-phase requirement
4. **Heated Hoses**: Specialized plural component hoses (expensive)
5. **Fresh Air Breathing Systems**: Safety requirement
6. **Transfer Pumps**: Move chemicals from drums to proportioner
7. **Barrel Pumps & Drum Heaters**: Temperature control
8. **Forklift**: For loading 55-gallon chemical drums

### Equipment Variations by Application:
- **Residential/Small Commercial**: Air-driven or electric machines (lower pressure/output)
- **Large Commercial/Roofing**: Hydraulic machines (high pressure/high output)
- **Power Requirements**: 40-60 kW generators standard

## Financing Options Research:

### Traditional Banking:
- **SBA 7(a) Loans**: Long-term, competitive rates, minimal down payments
- **Equipment Loans**: Equipment serves as collateral, 2-7 year terms typically
- **Business Lines of Credit**: Flexible working capital, draw as needed
- **Term Loans**: Lump sum, fixed payments, 1-10 year terms

### Alternative Financing:
- **Equipment Financing**: Specialized for equipment purchases, faster approval
- **Invoice Factoring**: For cash flow gaps (limited use for contractors)
- **Merchant Cash Advances**: Quick funding, higher cost
- **Online Lenders**: Faster approval, more flexible requirements

### Key Banking Relationship Benefits:
- Lower interest rates with established relationships

- Better loan terms for growth financing
- Business credit building opportunities

### Documentation Required:
- 2-3 years tax returns
- Profit & loss statements  
- Bank statements (3-4 months minimum)
- Business registration documents
- Equipment invoices/quotes
- Credit reports
