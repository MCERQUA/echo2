# Sumagoo Image Download Setup - Status Update

## ðŸš¨ Website Issue Detected

The website "sumagoo.com" cannot be accessed or resolved. This could be due to:

1. **Incorrect domain name** - The website might be spelled differently
2. **Website is down** - Temporary outage
3. **Different TLD** - Might be .net, .org, .co, etc.
4. **Geographic restrictions** - Site might be blocked in certain regions

## ðŸ“‹ Scripts Created and Ready

All download scripts have been created in Nick's safety folder:

- âœ… `download_sumagoo_images.py` - Python version (most comprehensive)
- âœ… `download_sumagoo_images.ps1` - PowerShell version  
- âœ… `download_homepage_images.ps1` - Quick PowerShell version
- âœ… `simple_download.sh` - Bash version
- âœ… `INSTRUCTIONS_DOWNLOAD_SUMAGOO.md` - Complete instructions

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps Required

Please provide:
1. **Correct website URL** for the safety equipment company
2. **Verification** that the website is accessible from your location
3. **Alternative spellings** if "Sumagoo" is not correct

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Run

Once the correct URL is provided, simply update the `BASE_URL` variable in any script:

**Python script:**
```python
BASE_URL = "https://correct-website.com"  # Update this line
```

**Bash script:**
```bash
BASE_URL="https://correct-website.com"  # Update this line
```

Then run the appropriate script based on your system setup.

## ðŸ“ž Alternative Approach

If you have specific product image URLs or can browse to the website manually, I can:
1. Create targeted download scripts for specific pages
2. Help extract image URLs from HTML you provide
3. Set up manual download lists

Let me know the correct website URL and we'll get those safety equipment images downloaded immediately!
