All images will be downloaded to:
```
/mnt/e/1-CLAUDE-CODE-PROJECTS/echo2/clients/NICK/safety/sumagoo-products/
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended - Most Comprehensive)

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

**Run the script:**
```bash
cd /mnt/e/1-CLAUDE-CODE-PROJECTS/echo2/clients/NICK/safety

```

**What it does:**

- Most thorough option

### Option 2: PowerShell Script (Pattern-based)

**Run the script:**
```powershell
cd /mnt/e/1-CLAUDE-CODE-PROJECTS/echo2/clients/NICK/safety
./download_sumagoo_images.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Scrapes homepage for images
- Tries common URL patterns for products
- Good middle-ground option
- No additional software needed

### Option 3: Quick PowerShell (Homepage Only)

**Run the script:**
```powershell
cd /mnt/e/1-CLAUDE-CODE-PROJECTS/echo2/clients/NICK/safety
./download_homepage_images.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Quick download of homepage images
- Tests common product image URLs
- Fastest option for testing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Python script fails:
1. **Install missing packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```

2. **Check internet connection:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://sumagoo.com
   ```

3. **Run with verbose output:**
   ```bash
   python3 download_sumagoo_images.py --verbose
   ```

### If PowerShell scripts fail:
1. **Enable script execution:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. **Check PowerShell version:**
   ```powershell
   $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
   ```

3. **Run with error details:**
   ```powershell
   ./download_sumagoo_images.ps1 -ErrorAction Continue
   ```

## üìä Expected Results

After running the scripts, you should see:
- A new folder: `sumagoo-products/`
- Image files with descriptive names
- Progress messages during download
- Summary of total images downloaded

## üîÑ Re-running Scripts

The scripts are designed to:
- Skip files that already exist
- Resume interrupted downloads

You can safely run them multiple times.

## üìã Manual Alternatives

1. **Use wget (Linux/Mac):**
   ```bash
   wget -r -l2 -A.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.gif,.webp https://sumagoo.com
   ```

2. **Use browser extensions:**
   - Image Downloader extensions
   - Bulk image downloaders

3. **Manual browsing:**
   - Visit https://sumagoo.com
   - Right-click and save images manually

   - Edit the `OUTPUT_DIR` variable in Python script
   - Edit the `$OutputDir` variable in PowerShell scripts

2. **Filter specific image types:**
   - Modify the file extension filters
   - Add/remove keywords for product filtering

3. **Adjust download delays:**
   - Change `DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS` in Python
   - Modify `Start-Sleep` values in PowerShell

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Ensure you have internet connectivity
3. Verify the Sumagoo website is accessible
